8.Overloading propogates up the inheritance chain and overriding propogates down from the declared class of the object which calls the method. It binds to the  nearest method which is overloaded irrespective of the actual Type of the argument(if the argument is a reference data type).Or else it gets binded to the method defined in the actual type of the calling object.     A obj = new B(); here A is declared type and B is actual type and B extends A
